# costco-coupon
Hi, welecome to my project on predicting when items will go on sale at Costco. 

To run the model, download this repository, and run: python3 model.py in terminal. Feel free to adjust the epochs, batch size, learning rate, etc, to adjust my model but I found the current settings to be optimal (60% accuracy within 2 months). The next time you want to make another prediction, instead of running the model again, simply run predictory.py and it will load the model from your previous session.
